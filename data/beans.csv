Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Consider minimum tillage to reduce cost and to conserve soil, water and nutrients, and to reduce workload Slash and plant using appropriate tools e.g. rippers, jab planters, dibbler, oxen-drawn equipment e.g. the ripper, tractor-drawn no till planter.
Ploughing is done by preparing the soil using chisel ploughs to avoid fine tilths.
Hoes and oxen-drawn implements can be used.
Contour farming technique recommended.
Add manure and fertilizers to the soil in the right amounts to provide the required plant nutrients for vigorous crop growth.
Maintain soil health for good production and income.
Test soils first to guide the application of manure and fertilizer.
Apply only deficient nutrients.
Consider using conservation farming approaches minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, crop rotation, soil conservation measures"," prepare the land properly for planting. 
Make sure the soil is well-drained and aerated to avoid waterlogging.
 You can also add organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.
","
Prepare the land by tilling the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm to
 ensure good aeration and to break up any hard soil. 
This will help the soil to retain water and prevent water runoff.
","Before planting beans, do not over-till or
  dig the land in order to conserve the soil, water and nutrients.","Kabla ya kupanda maharagwe, usilime au kuchimba 
 ardhi sana, ili kuhifadhi udongo, maji na virutubisho."
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"Beans are very sensitive to excess micronutrients such as Boron, Zinc, Copper, and Molybdenum, Always have a soil test done before you plant anything on your farm. Fertigation is important because it feeds the beans with additional nutrients that it requires to grow
Nitrogen fertilizer should be added to the plant during every irrigation cycle. This should stop when the foliage has fully developed.
Potassium should be added to bean plants while the pods are developing to speed up the growth process and increase the quality.
Bean crops thrive in well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter, weed-free and has an ideal PH of 6-7.5. Waterlogged soils should be avoided.","
Use nitrogen-rich fertilizers to boost plant growth, 
but avoid over-fertilizing, as this can lead to excessive vegetative 
growth and poor pod development.
","
Use a balanced fertilizer with higher amounts of potassium and
 phosphorus than nitrogen. Potassium and phosphorus are 
essential for root development and water uptake, 
while nitrogen can encourage leaf growth at the expense of root growth.
","For beans, add manure and fertilizer with 
 recommendations from soil testing and analysis. 
 Gapping and thinning should be done 14 days after seed emergence.","Kwa maharagwe, ongeza mbolea na mapendekezo 
 kutoka kwa upimaji wa mchanga na uchambuzi. 
 Upunguzaji wa mimea unapaswa kufanywa siku 14 baada ya mbegu kuota."
Planting ,Sowing,"Temperature range The temperatures should be 20 – 30 o C.
Rainfall
The rainfall should be 750– 4000 mm Plant along the contour at the onset of rains and when the soil is moist.
Plant at the onset of rains e.g. 4 continuous days of sufficient rain to take advantage of nitrogen flush.
Plant along the contours or across the slope and when the soil is moist.
Fill gaps one to two weeks after planting when plants have emerged.
Thin to remove weak plants under moist soil conditions 14 days after emergence.
Beans pure stand; seed rate 23kgs per acre; 2-3 seeds per hole at 25 by 60 cm or 15 by 25 cm depending on variety.
Sort out good seeds to ensure that they are free from insects, disease infestation and weed seeds.
Do not use damaged or wrinkled seeds, or seeds with holes.
Planting bush beans in a monoculture on a flatbed is done by planting in rows which are 50 cm apart.
Within a row, plant seeds at 8-10 cm apart (1 seed per stand) or 15-20 cm apart (2 seeds per stand) planting.
Planting climbing beans: Plant climbing bean in rows which are 75 cm apart. Within a row, sow seeds 15 cm apart (1 seed per stand) or 25-30 cm apart (2 seeds per stand)
Do not plant beans in areas where the Nitrogen levels in the soil are too high or where green manure crops are lying idle on the ground. This is because the leaf beans might develop at the expense of the bean pods and this will decrease yields
Do not fertilize the seeded area. Bean seeds cannot grow with the added influx of elements. Wait until the plant has full foliage to fertilize. If you are concerned about your garden's nutritional deficiencies, you can use a home soil test kit to verify the elements needed. Do not blindly fertilize if the soil does not require it.","
Plant your beans in raised beds to avoid waterlogging. 
Sow the seeds at a shallow depth and ensure proper spacing to allow 
for good airflow.
","Seeds should be planted deeper than normal to reach moist soil.
The planting should be done just before expected rainfall to help with germination.
The use of mulch around the seedlings can help retain moisture in the soil,
protect the plants from drying out, and prevent weed growth.
","-When planting beans, use certified seeds from 
 approved retailers or use farmer saved seeds after harvesting.
 -Plant beans at the onset of rains when the soil is moist.
  Practice the contour method for planting. Irrigate if necessary.","-Unapopanda maharage, tumia mbegu zilizothibitishwa 
 kutoka kwa wauzaji waliokubaliwa au tumia mbegu
 zilizohifadhiwa na mkulima baada ya kuvuna.
 -Panda maharagwe mwanzoni mwa mvua wakati mchanga ni mnyevu. 
 Tumia njia ya contour ya kupanda."
Harvest,Harvesting ,"Bean will produce up to 1.0–2.8 tons per ha
Dry pods in the sun, thresh and winnow to remove chaff and dust, re-dry to attain storage moisture content level.
Dry the pods on raised platforms, plastic, mat to avoid contact with moisture and other impurities.
It is advisable to do the threshing when the moisture level is 14-15%, If the seeds are too dry, the pods can be easily damaged during threshing, thresh the pods manually by beating with a stick.
After winnowing, grade the seeds to remove dust, damaged, broken and diseased seeds, separate the seeds by variety","Harvest your beans when they are mature, but avoid 
harvesting during wet weather to avoid damage to the pods and beans.
","Harvest the beans when the pods are fully
 mature and the beans inside are dry. 
","-Harvesting of beans should be done before the
  pods begin to shatter or rot, usually after 45 to 75 days after planting.
 -Harvest beans by hand picking the dried pods from the stem.
  Dry the pods in the sun, thresh and winnow to remove chaff and dust.","Uvunaji wa maharagwe unapaswa kufanywa 
 kabla ya maganda kuanza kuvunjika au kuoza,
  kawaida baada ya siku 45 hadi 75 baada ya kupanda.
 Vuna maharagwe kwa mkono ukichukua maganda
  yaliyokaushwa kutoka shina. Kausha maganda 
 kwenye jua, pura na sua ili kuondoa makapi na vumbi."
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Transport beans from the field to the place of storage or market using clean transport equipment.
Dry pods in the sun, thresh and winnow to remove chaff and dust, re-dry to attain storage moisture.
Store the seeds in clean or disinfected bags when the moisture content is 13-15%, do not mix the newly harvested grain with stocks from previous harvests.
Store the bags at least 1 meter away from the walls and on a raised platform. Store the bags in a non-leaking storehouse to avoid contact with moisture.
Treatment is done to protect the seed from damage by insect during storage, if the grain is going to be stored for longer periods, it is advisable to use chemical treatment but with care. Recommended chemicals for treating commons beans are: Actellic powder ( at the rate of 100gr in 100kg).","Dry the beans thoroughly to reduce moisture content and 
store the beans in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place to
 prevent moisture buildup and pest infestation.
","After harvesting, store the beans in a cool,
 dry place to prevent moisture buildup and mold growth.
","Store beans in airtight bags or metallic silos to 
 minimize use of pesticides. 
 You can also store them in sisal bags on raised pallets to protect from rodents.","Hifadhi maharage kwenye mifuko isiyopitisha
  hewa au silos za chuma ili kupunguza matumizi ya dawa za wadudu."
